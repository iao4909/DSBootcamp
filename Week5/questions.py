# ## Practice Questions
# 1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?
# Use the p-value which tells the probability of an observation occurring by chance, given the null hypothesis 

# 2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?
# The central limit theorum explains that in random and independent samples, the sample distribution of the means are normally distributed.
# The sample size must be large and this is important because it allows us to make assumptions with our data.

# 3. What is the statistical power?
# Statistical power is the likelihood of a significance test incorrectly detecting an effect.

# 4. How do you control for biases?
# To avoid bias, use diverse data and tools that check for unfair results or problems. 
# Make sure that different groups are represented fairly.
# Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

# 5. What are confounding variables?
# Cofounding variable can mess up the results because they appear to show a connection with the resulting data but do not.

# 6. What is A/B testing?
# A/B Testing is when two versions of something are compared in a divided sample group. 
# It helps businesses or developers choose the better of the two optuons.

# 7. What are confidence intervals?
# Confidence intervals are ranges around a measurement that shows how precise the measurement is based on the certainty and uncertainty of the sampling method.
